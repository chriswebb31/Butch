			<h1> About Butch</h1>
		</header>
		<p>			 
			Get ready for a 2d-adventure set in the late 1800â€™s. Ladies and gentlemen let me introduce you to BUTCH. Hold on,
			we're going back in time with Butch Cassidy on a historical trip with a rich story line filled with twist and turns.
			In a time of cowboys, slavery and The Civil War, Butch must prevail through the fluid sandbox to complete his 
			missions to unlock the skippable cut scenes filled in stunning 4K.
			We have a team of dedicated story developers, design and arts team and a storm of programmers working on 
			exciting projects to collaboratively and effectively develop the complete BUTCH  ADVENTURE !
			Multi-player servers with multiple story modes developed by TEAM 3 .
